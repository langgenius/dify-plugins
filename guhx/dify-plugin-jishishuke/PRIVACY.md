## JishiShuke API Tool Plugin Privacy Policy

This tool plugin acts as a client to send API requests to the JishiShuke API Marketplace.

**Data Collection:**

For the normal operation of the plugin, users are required to provide an API access credential (hereinafter referred to as "key") during the trial process on the Dify platform. The key is uniformly managed by the JishiShuke API Marketplace (api.jishishuke.com).
* `key`: An API access key used for identity verification.

When using the plugin, the following data may be processed and sent to JishiShuke:

* Field values that users need to query, such as IP addresses.

**Data Usage:**

* The collected key (`key`) is only used for API requests to the JishiShuke API Marketplace.
* The userâ€™s query field values are sent directly to the JishiShuke API Marketplace via API.
* The plugin itself does not persistently store any user data or credentials outside the runtime context. All data is only transmitted via API during request execution.

**Third-party Services / Self-hosted:**

* [JishiShuke API Marketplace Privacy Policy](https://api.jishishuke.com/agreement/privacy).
