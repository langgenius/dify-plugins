The Plugin does not collect, store, or otherwise process personal data. It does not track, log, or retain user information, supporting a privacy-first experience.

**3. Use of Third-Party Services**
The Plugin connects to Tencent Cloud services, including:

Tencent Cloud may handle certain data as part of providing these services. For details on Tencent Cloud's practices, see the Tencent RTC Privacy Policy: https://trtc.io/document/48827.
