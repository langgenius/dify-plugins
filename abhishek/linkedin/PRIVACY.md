# Privacy Policy

This LinkedIn plugin for Dify is designed to facilitate social media interactions via the LinkedIn professional network.

## Data Collection and Use

**This plugin does NOT collect any user personal data.** It only processes:

- **API Credentials**: This plugin requires LinkedIn OAuth credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) to authenticate with the LinkedIn API. These credentials are stored securely by Dify, not by the plugin.
- **Content**: The plugin transmits the content you provide (text, images, URLs) to LinkedIn to create posts or updates on your behalf.
- **Authentication State**: Dify secure storage is used to maintain the authentication state (access tokens). 

No personal identifiable information (PII) such as email addresses, IP addresses, names, or any other personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted by this plugin.

## Third-Party Services
This plugin interacts directly with the LinkedIn API. Your use of this plugin is also subject to the [LinkedIn Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).

## Security
We prioritize the security of your credentials. All communications with the LinkedIn API are performed over encrypted channels.
