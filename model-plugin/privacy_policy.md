## Data Collection and Use
This plugin only processes data required to call BytePlus ModelArk APIs, including:
- Model configuration provided by users (Model ID, endpoint, API Key).
- User inputs, prompts, and optional files sent by Dify applications.

The plugin transmits the above data to BytePlus ModelArk for model inference and does not store it locally after the request completes.

## Data Sharing
Data is shared with BytePlus ModelArk as the model service provider. Please review BytePlus ModelArk privacy and data processing policies for details:
