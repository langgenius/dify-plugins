# File Operation Toolkit Privacy Policy

## Data Processing Statement

This plugin provides file operation functions, primarily including but not limited to file hash calculation. We want you to understand how we handle your data when using this plugin:

### 1. Data Collection and Processing

- **File Content**: This plugin processes files uploaded by users or provided via URL, solely for calculating hash values and performing related operations.
- **Temporary Processing**: All file content is only temporarily processed in memory and is cleared after operations are completed, never being permanently stored.
- **Hash Results**: Calculated hash values are returned to the user and are not stored by the plugin.

### 2. Purpose of Data Usage

- File content is only used for hash calculation and file verification
- No user data or file content is used for training machine learning models or other purposes
- Data is not shared with any third parties

### 3. Data Security

- This plugin does not store any uploaded file content
- All processing occurs within the user's Dify instance and no data is sent to external services
- When using the URL download feature, the plugin requests the URL to obtain file content, but does not transmit the results to any location other than the user's Dify instance

### 4. User Rights

- Users have complete control over the data provided to the plugin
- Since no user data is stored, there is no need for a data deletion mechanism

### 5. Change Notification

- If there are any changes to this privacy policy, we will notify users through documentation provided during plugin version updates
